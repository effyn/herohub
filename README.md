# Herohub
Herohub is a web application that connects Overwatch players based on their individual preferences.

## An example
Sarah is a top 500 Mercy player. She has selected preferences that indicate that she is looking for:

* DPS and tank players
* Players close to her SR
* Other support players that do not play Mercy often
* Hero-specific synergies (Pharah, Winston)
* Players that use voice communication

Selecting more preferences will only make matches more relevant and does not decrease the amount of matches she will see. Being specific about what she looks for in a teammate offers a better experience for everyone.
